/*A stakeholder in the HR department wants to do some change-tracking but is concerned that the stream which was created for them gives them too much info they donâ€™t care about.

Load in the parquet data and transform it into a table, then create a stream that will only show us changes to the DEPT and JOB_TITLE columns. 

You can find the parquet data here.

Execute the following commands:

UPDATE employees SET COUNTRY = 'Japan' WHERE EMPLOYEE_ID = 8;
UPDATE employees SET LAST_NAME = 'Forester' WHERE EMPLOYEE_ID = 22;
UPDATE employees SET DEPT = 'Marketing' WHERE EMPLOYEE_ID = 25;
UPDATE employees SET TITLE = 'Ms' WHERE EMPLOYEE_ID = 32;
UPDATE employees SET JOB_TITLE = 'Senior Financial Analyst' WHERE EMPLOYEE_ID = 68;*/
